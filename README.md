# XD HAX Sample Project

This sample project creates a voice skill for Amazon Echo that can interact with the Xero API to retrieve data and present it back to the user using voice.

It is not intended to be feature complete, but more a starting point for developers to build on for their hack projects.

### Getting Started

- Clone the Repo
- Read the README.MD files in `alexa-xero-linking-service` and `xbot-alexa-skill`

### What you will need

- AWS Account
- Amazon Developer Account
- Xero Account

Good Luck!
